LGS-LUA

Logitech G-Series LUA API

For full documentation of each command:

1. Click on the down arrow on the lower left of the profile icon.
2. Click "Scripting"
3. On top of the new window, click on "Help"
4. Click "Scripting API"

Why?
====
I made this autocompletion list because it saves a lot of time typing all the functions out and troubleshooting from a missed capitalization. I hope it helps everyone that uses the Logitech Gamin Software LUA scripting to accomplish what they need to faster. 

Want to help?
=============
Although the project is about as complete as can be, you might see something I haven't! If you do, either open up a ticket or fork the project and then send  pull request for review. Any and all help would be appreciated.
