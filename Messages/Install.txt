Logitech G-Series LUA API
=========================

Thank you for downloading the LGS LUA API. I created it to make it easier for the people that use the LUA scripting for Logitech Gaming Software. 

For full documentation of each command:
1: Click on the down arrow on the lower left of the profile icon.
2: Click "Scripting"
3: On top of the new window, click on "Help"
4: Click "Scripting API"
